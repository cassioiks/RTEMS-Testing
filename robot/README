Fire Marshal Bill source code

Copyright (c) 2003 by Matt Cross <matt@dragonflyhollow.org>

This code is the code which controls Fire Marshal Bill, a robot I
built for the 2003 Trinity College Home Fire-Fighting Robot Contest
http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/ .

It runs on the MRM332 board (see http://www.robominds.com).  It
requires the 512K ram upgrade, and a 25MHz processor (which is
standard by now).  It runs under the RTEMS operating system (see
http://www.rtems.com).

For more details on this code, please refer to 'description.txt' or to
my web site at:

Minimal build instructions:

1. Build RTEMS with support for (at least) the MRM332 BSP.

2. Set the environment variable RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH to the path where
   the mrm332 BSP is installed (which is /opt/rtems/m68k-rtems/mrm332
   by default).

3. Type 'make'.

The output file will be o-optimize/test.exe, which can be burned into
the flash using my 'flashtool' utility and the BDM cable.  It can also
be downloaded into the flash using the flash support built into
CPUBUG32 that ships with the MRM, but that will take much longer.

You can also build the code to run from RAM for debugging by
commenting out the line in the Makefile that sets MRM_IN_ROM to yes.
The ram executable will be in o-optimise/test.nxe.  To run the ram
executable under gdb:

1. Ensure you have the BDM cable installed correctly and have built
   the bdm driver and gdb with bdm support.

2. Copy the file 'mrmgdbinit' from the flashtool into this directory.

2. Type 'gdb o-optimize/test.nxe'

3. At the gdb prompt, type:
	source mrmgdbinit
	load
	set $pc=0x10008

4. At this point, the program is loaded and ready to go.  Set any
   breakpoints you would like, and then type 'c' (don't type 'run'!)
   to start it.
